# Math & Coding Annotations

This repository contains annotated examples of common algorithms and mathematical problem-solving techniques. Each script demonstrates not only the logic behind solving the problem but also attention to clarity, structure, and documentation â€” essential for technical communication and data annotation roles.

## Contents

- `binary_search_annotated.py`: Efficient search algorithm with comments.
- `dp_fibonacci_commentary.py`: Dynamic programming version of Fibonacci.
- `ode_control_example.py`: Sample ODE control system based on final year project.
