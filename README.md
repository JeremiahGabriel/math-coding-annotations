# Math & Coding Annotations

This repository showcases well-annotated implementations of fundamental algorithms and mathematical modeling techniques. Each file is crafted to demonstrate not just problem-solving ability, but also clarity, structure, and precision—key qualities in data annotation, algorithm design, and technical communication.

## 📁 Contents

- [`binary_search_annotated.py`](binary_search_annotated.py): Efficient implementation of the binary search algorithm with clear inline comments and logic flow.
- [`dp_fibonacci_commentary.py`](dp_fibonacci_commentary.py): Dynamic programming approach to the Fibonacci sequence, highlighting space-time optimization.
- [`ode_control_example.py`](ode_control_example.py): Sample ODE system inspired by an optimal control problem, solved using Python’s `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`.
